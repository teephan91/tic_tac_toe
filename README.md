## About
This program allows you to play the classic Tic Tac Toe with one of your friends. You begin with choosing between the two marks. Then proceed to the game. You have the option of restarting mid-game. When a result is reached, win, lose or draw, the program will announce and give you a button to start over again if you like.

## What I Did
I just completed a Tic Tac Toe game program that allows users to play with their friends. The project is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it showcases my skills in object-oriented programming (OOP) using JS factory functions and modules.

Some of the highlights from this project:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming:** The entire project follows the principles of OOP. I utilized factory functions and modules to create JS objects, which helped organize the code efficiently and promote reusability.
2. **Modularity:** By employing modules, I divided the program into smaller, manageable parts. This modular approach allowed me to include only the necessary components, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
3. **Namespace Conflict Prevention:** Using modules helped avoid potential namespace conflicts, ensuring that variables and functions with the same names in different modules don't interfere with each other.
4. **Game Flow Control:** Within the objects created using factory functions, I implemented methods and functions to manage the flow of the Tic Tac Toe game. These methods handle player moves, check for win conditions, and manage the game's state.
5. **CSS and HTML:** As part of the project, I also practiced CSS and a bit of HTML to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface for the Tic Tac Toe game.

Overall, this project provided an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, practice modular organization, and enhance my skills in web development using HTML and CSS. I'm excited to have completed this project and look forward to exploring more advanced concepts and projects in the future.

## Installation & Set Up

2. And to have all the files locally on your computer, open Terminal -> change the current directory to the directory you want to put this forked repo. Then, enter the command line below:
```
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/tic_tac_toe.git
```
- **Note**: If you change the name of your forked repo, replace 'tic_tac_toe.git' with '[your-forked-repo-name].git'. Github will automatically do this for you when you copy the link.
3. Finally, change to your new forked repo directory.
